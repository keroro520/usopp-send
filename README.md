# Usopp-Send

Usopp-Send is a tool for comparing transaction propagation speed across different Solana RPC nodes by sending mutually conflicting transactions and tracking which one confirms first.

## Project Overview

Different RPC nodes can have varying transaction propagation speeds due to differences in geographic location, network topology, and server load. Usopp-Send helps identify which RPC nodes provide the fastest path to transaction confirmation by quantifying their "path quality."

The tool works by:
1. Constructing multiple conflicting transactions (using the same sender account)
2. Sending each transaction through a different RPC node simultaneously
3. Monitoring which transaction confirms first
4. Reporting detailed metrics about transaction confirmation times

## Key Features

- **Fair Transaction Dispatch**: Uses a two-phase approach with system threads and oneshot channels to ensure transactions are sent simultaneously
- **Conflicting Transaction Construction**: Creates transactions that transfer decreasing percentages of the sender's balance

## Example

```
cargo run --release
```
